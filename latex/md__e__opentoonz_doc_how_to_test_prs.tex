When a PR is submitted, it is compiled automatically by App\+Veyor and Travis CI. The App\+Veyor build creates an artifact which contains the Open\+Toonz executable and supporting DLLs needed to run. You can easily download this artifact and run it to test out the PR before it is merged.\hypertarget{md__e__opentoonz_doc_how_to_test_prs_autotoc_md119}{}\doxysection{Pre-\/\+Testing Notes}\label{md__e__opentoonz_doc_how_to_test_prs_autotoc_md119}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This can only be tested on Windows. There is no OSX or Linux build that can be tested.
\item You need to have Open\+Toonz already installed. Do not uninstall.
\item Your current personal preferences and settings will be used.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Personal settings can change if you change them while testing.
\item It is recommended that you backup your {\ttfamily C\+:\textbackslash{}Open\+Toonz \#.\# stuff} folder before testing a PR.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The App\+Veyor build does not contain an updated {\ttfamily C\+:\textbackslash{}Open\+Toonz \#.\# stuff} folder so any PR changes to default configurations (i.\+e. stylesheets, FXs, brushes, etc) are not automatically included.
\item It is recommended when testing to use new scenes that you can throw away.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If you decide to test on an existing scene, back it up first!
