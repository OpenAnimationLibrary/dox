\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains an implementation of the {\itshape pool} container concept. 

A pool is a container that supports two fundamental operations, acquire() and release(), whose purpose is that of marking access operations to a resource that {\itshape should not be destroyed} when the access operation ends.

Creation and destruction of resources can be a time-\/consuming task that could be avoided when it is known that resources could be reused -\/ which is the very reason why caching can be a useful approach to some problems.

The classical cache concept is nothing more than that of a standard associative map, tweaked to accommodate specific commodities -\/ such as managing the cache size.

However, sometimes resources could be considered to be effectively identical, to the point that assigning a key is merely a way to keep the objects distinct in the cache. Users are in the condition to require only two functions, one to acquire() a resource, the other to release() it.

The Pool concept we are introducing satisfies the following ruleset\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The pool is a dynamical container which allocates resources by invoking the objects\textquotesingle{} default constructor.  
\item Objects in the pool are {\bfseries{not}} destructed, except when the pool is explicitly {\itshape squeezed} by the user. 
\item Keys are indices, returned by the pool with an incremental ordering.  
\item An object which has been acquired cannot be acquired again until it has been released  
\end{DoxyItemize}
